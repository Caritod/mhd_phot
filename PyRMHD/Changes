List of changes being made to the code
(sorry por el english, me entrevero programming en modo castellano)

4/8/14 -AE
-Changed splity and splitz to swapy and swapz, both routines are
 in a new file swaps.f90, and the makefile changed accordingly.
-Renamed project.f90 file to lyman_alpha_tau.f90, changes included the
 makefile as well, to compile Lyman Alpha Calculation use 
 'make lyman_alpha_tau'
-Added the MHD fluxes in the uuk's for k=r in hhlcfluxes.f90
-Updated huachoUtils.py to include neqE **kwarg to compute the
 Temperature cut.
 Its value is that of the equation number that corresponds to the internal
 energy minus 1 (because python arrays start from 0).
 Default value is 4, which should correspond to the hydro runs. 
 For runs with the passive magnetic field it should be set to 8-1=7 example
 T=coplotTemp(2,nytot/2,neqs,nxtot,nytot,nztot,mpiX,mpiY,mpiZ,nout,path=path,cv=cv,Tempsc=tempsc,neqE=7)

4/9/14 -AE
-Changed all the MHD precompiler flags to PMHD (Passive MHD), to leave
 room to use full MHD in the NEAR future

4/10/14 -AE
-Added HLL solver, changes in the makefile and to tstep.f90
 to make room for it and a new file hllfluxes.f90 in the source
-Turned off the source terms in the makefile, and the B passive 
 field seems to work. We need to correct the sources.f90 routine or
 return the enrergy/pressure equation to the 5th index and the
 B field to 6,7 and 8



(yo no me animo a escribir en english)
4/11/14 -CV
-Cambié la ubicación de las variables, ahora estan 
  (rho,vx,vy,vz,pgas,bx,by,bz,neutros)

30/04/2014 M y C
- Agregamos los parámetros de escalamiento para el campo magnetico en parameters.f90 con la opción a la MHD pasiva
(vsc= v termica para HD y vsc= v alfven para MHD Pasiva)

21/05/2014
- Changes in makefile, beginning of real MHD

05/06/2014
-  Hopefully this file will not be needed as we're migrating to github. let's see if it works.
